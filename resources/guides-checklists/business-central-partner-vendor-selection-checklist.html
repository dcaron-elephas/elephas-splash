    <h1>Business Central Partner and Vendor Selection Checklist</h1>

    <p>Choosing the right Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central partner is one of the most important decisions you will make for your implementation. The software is powerful, but outcomes depend heavily on who designs, configures, and supports it with you. This checklist gives you a structured way to compare potential partners so you can move beyond glossy slides and focus on fit.</p>

    <h2>1. Basic Fit And Experience</h2>
    <p>Start by confirming that the partner has real experience with Business Central and with companies that look like yours.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They are an active Microsoft partner with clear Business Central focus, not just a general reseller.</li>
      <li>They can describe how many Business Central implementations they have completed in the last two to three years.</li>
      <li>They have experience in your industry or with similar operational models, for example rentals, distribution, manufacturing, or services.</li>
      <li>They can show examples of projects that are similar in size and complexity to yours, not only very small or very large clients.</li>
      <li>They understand your current system landscape, for example QuickBooks, NAV, legacy ERPs, or custom systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Team Structure And Roles</h2>
    <p>Know who will actually work on your project, not just who appears in the sales meeting.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are introduced to the proposed project manager or lead consultant, not only an account executive.</li>
      <li>They explain how many people will be assigned to your project and in what roles, for example solution architect, functional consultants, technical consultants, and integration specialists.</li>
      <li>You understand where the team is located and what time zones they work in.</li>
      <li>They clarify which work is done by employees and which, if any, is subcontracted.</li>
      <li>There is named ownership for integrations, data migration, and change management, not just “we will handle that.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Approach To Discovery And Design</h2>
    <p>A strong partner starts with understanding your business, not by rushing to configuration.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They run a structured discovery phase that includes process walkthroughs and workshops, not just a questionnaire.</li>
      <li>They document current processes and pain points in language your team recognizes.</li>
      <li>They propose a target design that maps your core processes onto standard Business Central capabilities first, with customizations used only where needed.</li>
      <li>They identify risks and assumptions early, for example complex pricing or legacy customizations that must be replaced.</li>
      <li>They can explain how design decisions will be validated with key users before heavy configuration and development begin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Implementation Methodology</h2>
    <p>Ask how they structure the implementation and how work moves from idea to live.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They use a clear methodology that covers discovery, configuration, data migration, integrations, testing, training, and go live support.</li>
      <li>They favor iterative build and review cycles so your team can see the system early and often.</li>
      <li>They have a plan for environment management, for example separate development, test, and production tenants.</li>
      <li>They can describe how change requests are handled during the project, including impact on scope, budget, and timeline.</li>
      <li>They explain how they manage project communication, for example weekly status calls, shared issue trackers, and decision logs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Integration And Architecture Capability</h2>
    <p>For many businesses, Business Central is one part of a larger architecture that includes websites, portals, and line of business applications.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can describe previous projects where Business Central was integrated with websites, ecommerce, portals, or other systems.</li>
      <li>They understand the difference between direct table integration and safer patterns such as staging tables and intake APIs.</li>
      <li>They can talk about real time versus batch integrations in practical terms and help you decide what should be which.</li>
      <li>They have a plan for logging, monitoring, and supporting integrations after go live.</li>
      <li>They are comfortable coordinating with your web and infrastructure teams rather than treating integration as an afterthought.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Migration Strategy</h2>
    <p>Data migration often drives timeline and risk. A good partner treats it as a project within the project.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They ask early about the quality and structure of your current data.</li>
      <li>They explain which data will be migrated in detail and which will be summarized or archived.</li>
      <li>They define responsibilities for data cleaning, mapping, and validation.</li>
      <li>They plan for multiple test migrations before the final cutover.</li>
      <li>They include time for your team to review migrated data in Business Central and sign off.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Customization And Extension Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Some customization is often necessary, but too much can hurt upgrades and maintainability.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They prefer configuration and standard capabilities over heavy custom code where possible.</li>
      <li>They use Business Central extensions and supported APIs rather than direct modifications to core objects.</li>
      <li>They can explain how customizations will be documented and tracked.</li>
      <li>They talk honestly about long term implications of custom work, including upgrades and support.</li>
      <li>They are open to saying “no” or “not yet” when a requested feature would damage the overall design.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Training, Change Management, And Adoption</h2>
    <p>Success depends on people using the system confidently, not just on configuration quality.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They provide a training plan tailored to different roles, for example finance, operations, sales, and management.</li>
      <li>They create or help create documentation that matches how your team speaks about processes.</li>
      <li>They encourage early involvement of super users who can champion the system internally.</li>
      <li>They address change management concerns directly, such as new responsibilities, approvals, and reporting structures.</li>
      <li>They offer options for post go live coaching or office hours, not only initial classroom training.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Support Model After Go Live</h2>
    <p>Ask as much about life after go live as you do about the project itself.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They have a defined support offering with response time targets and severity levels.</li>
      <li>They explain how incidents are logged, tracked, and communicated.</li>
      <li>They offer a path for minor enhancements and optimizations that inevitably appear after go live.</li>
      <li>They clarify what is covered under support versus separate projects or change orders.</li>
      <li>They are willing to review system health periodically and recommend improvements rather than only reacting to tickets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Commercial Terms And Transparency</h2>
    <p>Make sure you understand how you will be billed and what flexibility you have.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They provide a clear estimate with assumptions, not just a single lump sum.</li>
      <li>They explain the pricing model, for example fixed fee for defined scope, time and materials, or a hybrid.</li>
      <li>They outline license costs, implementation services, and ongoing support separately.</li>
      <li>They describe how scope changes and overruns are handled and who must approve them.</li>
      <li>They are willing to share example invoices or anonymized project breakdowns so you see how charges appear in practice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. References And Reputation</h2>
    <p>References are more useful when you ask specific questions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can provide references who are similar to your organization in size and complexity.</li>
      <li>You ask references about communication, transparency, and how the partner handled surprises.</li>
      <li>You ask how the system is working one year after go live, not only how the project felt in the moment.</li>
      <li>You look for patterns across references, both positive and negative.</li>
      <li>You check whether the same key people who delivered those projects will be available for yours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How To Use This Checklist In Your Selection Process</h2>
    <p>You do not need perfect scores in every category. The goal is to compare partners against the factors that matter most to you.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Highlight the sections that are critical for your situation, such as integrations, data migration, or change management.</li>
      <li>Use the checklist as a question guide during partner interviews and demos.</li>
      <li>Score or annotate each vendor against the checklist so you can compare them side by side.</li>
      <li>Share your notes with both business and IT stakeholders so the decision reflects multiple perspectives.</li>
      <li>Revisit the checklist after selection as a starting point for your statement of work and project charter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Elephas Supports Business Central Partner Decisions</h2>
    <p>For some organizations, the hardest part is not running the project, it is choosing the right team to run it with. Elephas can help by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clarifying your implementation goals and constraints before you talk to vendors.</li>
      <li>Helping you translate this checklist into a short request for information or request for proposal.</li>
      <li>Reviewing partner proposals for alignment with your processes, systems, and integration requirements.</li>
      <li>Advising on architecture and integration patterns if you plan to connect Business Central with web, portal, or custom systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The result is a selection process that is grounded in your real business needs and architecture, not only in demos and price sheets, so you choose a Business Central partner that can support you well beyond go live.</p>
