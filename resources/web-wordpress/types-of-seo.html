    <h1>The Main Types of SEO (And Which Ones Actually Matter For Your Website)</h1>

    <p>There is not just one thing called SEO. There are several types of SEO working together, including technical, on page, content, authority, and local. Most sites do a little bit of everything by accident. The sites that consistently win pick a few types to focus on, get them right, and build from there.</p>

    <h2>Why Thinking in Types of SEO Matters</h2>
    <p>When someone says we need SEO, they usually mean one of three different things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our site is slow or something is broken, which points to technical SEO.</li>
      <li>We are not showing up for the searches we care about, which points to on page and content SEO.</li>
      <li>Our competitors always outrank us, which points to authority and content SEO.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you do not separate these, you can end up buying the wrong services and measuring the wrong results.</p>
    <p>Thinking in types of SEO gives you a simple framework:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is actually broken?</li>
      <li>What is already good enough?</li>
      <li>Where should you invest first?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Technical SEO, Can Search Engines Crawl and Trust Your Site?</h2>
    <p>Technical SEO is everything that affects how easily search engines can crawl, index, and understand your site.</p>
    <p>Typical technical SEO work includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixing crawl errors and broken links</li>
      <li>Improving page speed and Core Web Vitals</li>
      <li>Making sure the site works well on mobile</li>
      <li>Setting up XML sitemaps and robots.txt correctly</li>
      <li>Handling canonical URLs and duplicate content</li>
      <li>Adding structured data such as schema markup</li>
      <li>Cleaning up messy URL structures and redirect chains</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If search engines cannot crawl or trust your site, nothing else you do will perform the way it should. Strong technical SEO does not win rankings on its own, but weak technical SEO can quietly block everything else.</p>
    <p><strong>When to prioritize it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are launching or redesigning a site.</li>
      <li>You have many pages that should rank but rarely appear.</li>
      <li>You see crawl errors, index bloat, or major speed problems.</li>
      <li>Developers and marketers are stepping on each other’s toes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. On Page SEO, Making Each Page a Clear, Useful Answer</h2>
    <p>On page SEO is about the content and structure of each individual page.</p>
    <p>Typical on page elements include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Page titles and meta descriptions</li>
      <li>Headings and subheadings such as H1, H2, and H3</li>
      <li>Clear, focused URL slugs</li>
      <li>Body copy that actually answers the search intent</li>
      <li>Internal links to related pages</li>
      <li>Image file names and alt text</li>
      <li>Logical, scannable layout</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> On page SEO tells search engines, this page is about a specific topic and it serves a specific user intent. It is where you connect keywords with real problems and questions.</p>
    <p>For example, a page targeting business central WordPress integration might have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A title like, Business Central and WordPress Integration Guide.</li>
      <li>An H1 like, How to Connect Business Central With Your WordPress Site.</li>
      <li>Content that shows concrete steps, diagrams, and FAQs about that exact problem.</li>
      <li>Internal links to related implementation and integration content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>When to prioritize it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have good content that is not organized well.</li>
      <li>Titles and headings do not match what people actually search for.</li>
      <li>You are updating older content to perform better.</li>
      <li>You want to improve click through rate from search without rewriting everything.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Content and Topical SEO, Building Authority Around Subjects</h2>
    <p>Content SEO, or topical SEO, is about what you publish over time and how it fits together, not just how you optimize individual pages.</p>
    <p>Key ideas include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Topic clusters and pillars:</strong> Create one strong pillar page on a major topic, supported by multiple focused articles that go deeper on subtopics.</li>
      <li><strong>Topical authority:</strong> Show up consistently around a subject, not with one article, but with a whole library that covers real questions, use cases, and edge cases.</li>
      <li><strong>Search intent mapping:</strong> Align content to different stages such as early research, solution comparison, implementation how to, and pricing, risk, and proof.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Search engines increasingly reward sites that are clearly the place for a topic. A scattered blog with random posts about everything rarely builds that signal.</p>
    <p><strong>When to prioritize it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You already have a stable site and decent technical foundations.</li>
      <li>You want organic traffic that compounds over time.</li>
      <li>You sell expertise, services, or complex solutions, not just simple products.</li>
      <li>You want SEO to support sales conversations, not just drive visits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Authority and Off Page SEO, Who Else Vouches For You?</h2>
    <p>Authority SEO, often called off page SEO, is about signals that live outside your site but influence how trustworthy you look.</p>
    <p>This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Backlinks from relevant, reputable sites</li>
      <li>Mentions and quotes in industry articles and roundups</li>
      <li>Digital PR and thought leadership</li>
      <li>Guest posts on aligned publications</li>
      <li>Reviews on platforms that matter in your space</li>
      <li>Branded search volume, meaning people looking for your name directly</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If technical, on page, and content SEO say what this page is about, authority SEO says how much the outside world seems to trust it. Two pages with similar content and technical quality often get separated by who has better links, more brand recognition, and stronger reviews and mentions.</p>
    <p><strong>When to prioritize it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are in a competitive space where everyone has decent content.</li>
      <li>You want to move from page two to page one for important terms.</li>
      <li>You have already fixed major technical and on page issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Local SEO, Showing Up For Near Me Searches</h2>
    <p>Local SEO matters if geography is part of how people choose you. This is the case when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have one or more physical locations.</li>
      <li>You serve defined territories or service areas.</li>
      <li>You care about searches like IT consulting Boston or ERP partner near me.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Local SEO usually involves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fully built out Google Business Profiles</li>
      <li>Consistent name, address, and phone across directories</li>
      <li>Local landing pages that make sense for users, not just search engines</li>
      <li>Collecting and responding to reviews</li>
      <li>Local content and case studies that show you understand the area or niche</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Local results often show above normal organic listings. If you ignore them, you lose visibility even when your website is strong.</p>
    <p><strong>When to prioritize it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You rely on nearby or regional clients.</li>
      <li>You are in a services business where being local enough is a factor.</li>
      <li>You are competing with other providers in the same geography.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Enterprise and Programmatic SEO, When Scale Changes the Game</h2>
    <p>Enterprise or programmatic SEO comes into play when you have a large or complex site, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hundreds or thousands of similar pages</li>
      <li>Large catalogs of content, services, locations, or products</li>
      <li>Multiple teams touching the site such as marketing, product, IT, and agencies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Typical activities include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designing templates that ship SEO best practices by default</li>
      <li>Generating large numbers of pages programmatically from structured data</li>
      <li>Applying schema, internal links, and meta tags at scale</li>
      <li>Using log files and crawl data to spot waste and opportunity</li>
      <li>Creating governance around redirects, new sections, and deprecations</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> At scale, you cannot hand craft everything. You need systems, rules, and automation that keep SEO intact as the site evolves.</p>
    <p><strong>When to prioritize it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are already doing the basics well but growth has flattened.</li>
      <li>You are planning a big site expansion, migration, or replatform.</li>
      <li>You have real SEO debt from years of patches and one off changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Which Types of SEO Should You Focus On First?</h2>
    <p>Here is a practical order of operations that works for most sites.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start with technical:</strong> Make sure search engines can crawl, index, and understand your site. If basic health is poor, fix that first.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer on on page and content:</strong> Align key pages with specific search intents and build out topic clusters around your main services and solutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Add authority efforts once the foundation is solid:</strong> Use partnerships, PR, and content promotion to earn relevant links and mentions.</li>
      <li><strong>Use local SEO selectively:</strong> If geography matters, treat local SEO as its own mini strategy, not an afterthought.</li>
      <li><strong>Think programmatic only when you are big enough:</strong> If you do not have hundreds of URLs, your time is better spent on fundamentals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You do not have to do everything at once. You do need to be honest about where you are weak and deliberate about where you invest.</p>

    <h2>How This Fits Into Your Website and Marketing Strategy</h2>
    <p>SEO is not a separate universe. It connects directly to other parts of your digital strategy, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Web and user experience:</strong> how usable and fast your site feels.</li>
      <li><strong>Content strategy:</strong> what you publish and why you publish it.</li>
      <li><strong>Sales:</strong> how well your site supports real buying conversations.</li>
      <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> how often changes accidentally break things.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you treat types of SEO as a menu of tactics, you can get very busy without seeing clear results. If you treat them as pillars that support your overall strategy, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pick a few types that align with your goals.</li>
      <li>Set realistic expectations and timelines.</li>
      <li>Measure progress in more than just rankings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That is where SEO stops being a buzzword and starts behaving like an actual growth channel.</p>
