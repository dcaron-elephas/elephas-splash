  <h1>Business Central&ndash;WordPress Integration: A Practical Blueprint for Growing Businesses</h1>

  <p>
    Most growing businesses already rely on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central to keep the back office running smoothly, but the website is still a disconnected island. This guide shows you how to connect Business Central and WordPress in practical steps&mdash;covering architecture, data flows, performance, security, and a phased rollout&mdash;so your website becomes a real extension of your ERP and starts delivering value in weeks, not years.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your website and Business Central should share data, not duplicate it.</li>
    <li>Start with a few high-value data flows (e.g., products, quotes, customer status) instead of &ldquo;integrating everything.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>Use a clear architecture: Business Central &rarr; integration layer &rarr; WordPress, with proper auth and caching.</li>
    <li>Plan a phased rollout (30/60/90 days) to ship value quickly and reduce risk.</li>
    <li>Good governance (security, data ownership, monitoring) matters as much as the code.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Your ERP and Website Need to Talk</h2>
  <p>
    Business Central is your system of record for products, pricing, customers, orders, and finances. Your website is where prospects and customers expect real-time answers. When those two worlds don&rsquo;t talk, your team ends up re-typing information, chasing down status updates, and manually fixing avoidable errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Common symptoms of a disconnected setup:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Quotes submitted on the website must be manually entered into Business Central.</li>
    <li>Product information on the site doesn&rsquo;t match what&rsquo;s actually in your ERP.</li>
    <li>Customers email or call for basic information they should be able to self-serve.</li>
    <li>Reporting is slow because key data is fragmented across systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Integration isn&rsquo;t about fancy technology for its own sake. It&rsquo;s about making sure the systems you already own work together so your team can focus on higher-value work, not repetitive data entry.
  </p>

  <h2>What a Connected Business Central + WordPress Setup Looks Like</h2>
  <p>
    A well-integrated setup turns your website into a front-door interface for Business Central, without exposing your ERP directly to the internet. At a high level:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Business Central</strong> remains the source of truth for master data.</li>
    <li>An <strong>integration layer</strong> (custom APIs, middleware, or a plugin) handles secure communication.</li>
    <li><strong>WordPress</strong> renders that data into pages, forms, and portals your users actually touch.</li>
  </ul>

         alt="Diagram showing Business Central, an integration layer, and a WordPress website connected with bidirectional arrows">
    <figcaption>Figure 1 &ndash; High-level architecture for Business Central&ndash;WordPress integration.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Examples of what you can deliver in a connected setup:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Product and service information on the website that is synced from Business Central.</li>
    <li>Website forms that create quotes, leads, or opportunities directly in Business Central.</li>
    <li>Customer self-service pages that surface order history, status, or invoice information.</li>
    <li>Dashboards and reports that combine website and ERP activity in one view.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Integration Architecture 101</h2>
  <p>
    There are many ways to wire systems together, but most successful Business Central&ndash;WordPress integrations share a few core patterns.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Components</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Business Central APIs / OData:</strong> Standard endpoints for reading and writing data.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication &amp; authorization:</strong> Typically via Azure AD app registrations and OAuth2.</li>
    <li><strong>Integration layer:</strong> A set of services, middleware, or custom plugins that know how to talk to both Business Central and WordPress.</li>
    <li><strong>WordPress front end:</strong> Templates, shortcodes, blocks, or custom endpoints that expose the data in a usable way.</li>
  </ul>

  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/img/resources/bc-wp-request-flow.png"
         alt="Flow diagram illustrating requests from a user’s browser to WordPress, then to an integration layer, and finally to Business Central">
    <figcaption>Figure 2 &ndash; Request flow from website visitor to Business Central through an integration layer.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3>Why You Don&rsquo;t Want WordPress Talking Directly to Business Central</h3>
  <p>
    It&rsquo;s technically possible to call Business Central directly from WordPress, but it usually leads to problems:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security risks:</strong> You end up embedding credentials or tokens too close to the front end.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance issues:</strong> High-traffic pages can overload Business Central with requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Tight coupling:</strong> Any change in Business Central can break the website and vice versa.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A separate integration layer (even if it&rsquo;s implemented as a well-structured WordPress plugin) gives you a place to centralize authentication, logging, error handling, and caching.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Data Flows to Start With</h2>
  <p>
    You don&rsquo;t need to integrate everything at once. Start with a few flows that are easy to implement and clearly tied to business value.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Products and Services &rarr; Website</h3>
  <p>
    Synchronize product or service details from Business Central to WordPress so your site reflects current offerings, descriptions, and key attributes.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Business Central remains the master source for item data.</li>
    <li>WordPress stores a subset optimized for fast display (e.g., via custom post types or fields).</li>
    <li>Scheduled jobs or webhooks keep the two in sync.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Website Forms &rarr; Quotes or Leads</h3>
  <p>
    Instead of forms that just send an email, have WordPress call your integration layer to create:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sales quotes or opportunities in Business Central.</li>
    <li>Customer or contact records when needed.</li>
    <li>Tasks or notifications for your sales or operations team.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is often the quickest way to prove value: less manual re-entry, faster follow-up, and cleaner data.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Customer Status &rarr; Self-Service Views</h3>
  <p>
    Start small with read-only self-service:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Order status pages.</li>
    <li>Basic account info.</li>
    <li>Recent invoices or transactions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Later, you can extend this into a full customer portal with secure logins, payments, and requests, supported by solid data structures and authentication.
  </p>

  <h2>Performance &amp; Caching Principles</h2>
  <p>
    The fastest Business Central call is the one that doesn&rsquo;t happen. Performance comes from smart caching and choosing when to read directly from BC versus from a local copy.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cache frequently accessed data:</strong> Products, attributes, and other semi-static information can be synced and stored in WordPress.</li>
    <li><strong>Use background refresh:</strong> Refresh caches on a schedule or on change, not on every page view.</li>
    <li><strong>Be intentional with real-time calls:</strong> Use them only when the user truly needs up-to-the-second information.</li>
  </ul>

  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/img/resources/bc-wp-cache-layer.png"
         alt="Diagram showing a cache layer between Business Central and WordPress to reduce direct ERP calls">
    <figcaption>Figure 3 &ndash; Caching layer to protect Business Central and keep the site fast.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Think of Business Central as the source of truth, not the primary rendering engine for your site. Let WordPress and your integration layer do the heavy lifting for user-facing traffic.
  </p>

  <h2>Security &amp; Governance</h2>
  <p>
    Integration should make your business faster, not more exposed. A few essentials:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use service accounts and app registrations:</strong> Avoid sharing personal user credentials between systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Apply least privilege:</strong> Grant only the permissions required for the integration, nothing more.</li>
    <li><strong>Encrypt in transit:</strong> All communication between WordPress, the integration layer, and Business Central should use HTTPS with modern TLS.</li>
    <li><strong>Log and monitor:</strong> Track integration calls, failures, and unusual patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Plan for incident response:</strong> Know what you&rsquo;ll do if credentials are compromised or data is exposed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Governance also means deciding who owns which data and field definitions. Before you integrate, align on &ldquo;source of truth&rdquo; for key objects like customers, products, and pricing.
  </p>

  <h2>A Phased Rollout Plan (30 / 60 / 90 Days)</h2>
  <p>
    A phased plan lets you deliver value quickly while reducing risk and avoiding &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; launches.
  </p>

  <h3>First 30 Days: Prove the Basics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean up core data in Business Central (items, customers, key fields).</li>
    <li>Implement one or two read-only flows (e.g., products to WordPress).</li>
    <li>Convert a key form so it creates a quote or lead in Business Central.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Days 31&ndash;60: Expand Data Flows</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Add additional product attributes or related records.</li>
    <li>Introduce a simple customer status view (e.g., order tracking).</li>
    <li>Refine caching strategies and performance monitoring.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Days 61&ndash;90: Move Toward Self-Service</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Roll out authenticated areas or a simple portal.</li>
    <li>Expose more useful ERP data to customers (within clear security boundaries).</li>
    <li>Establish ongoing processes for data stewardship, monitoring, and incremental improvements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Integrating everything at once:</strong> Start with 2&ndash;3 high-impact flows.</li>
    <li><strong>Skipping data cleanup:</strong> Messy data in Business Central becomes messy data everywhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Over-customizing too early:</strong> Use standard patterns where possible; customize where it truly matters.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring error handling:</strong> Decide what happens when Business Central is unavailable or a call fails.</li>
    <li><strong>Underestimating security:</strong> Don&rsquo;t treat integration credentials as an afterthought.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What You&rsquo;ll Need from Your Team</h2>
  <p>
    Technology alone won&rsquo;t make integration successful. You&rsquo;ll also need:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>A business owner for each key process:</strong> Someone who can decide how things should work end-to-end.</li>
    <li><strong>Data ownership:</strong> Clear accountability for master data quality in Business Central.</li>
    <li><strong>IT and web collaboration:</strong> ERP admins and web developers working from the same picture, not separate roadmaps.</li>
    <li><strong>Decision cadence:</strong> A regular rhythm for resolving questions and prioritizing changes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>FAQs: Business Central&ndash;WordPress Integration</h2>

  <h3>1. Is Business Central&ndash;WordPress integration only for large companies?</h3>
  <p>
    No. In many ways, growing small and mid-sized businesses benefit the most. You&rsquo;re close enough to the work to see manual friction clearly, and small changes can have a big impact on efficiency and customer experience.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Do we have to rebuild our website to integrate with Business Central?</h3>
  <p>
    Usually not. If your site is already on WordPress, you can often integrate using custom plugins, APIs, and structured data models rather than a full redesign. Many organizations pair integration work with a visual refresh, but it isn&rsquo;t strictly required.
  </p>

  <h3>3. How long does a basic integration take?</h3>
  <p>
    A focused first phase&mdash;such as syncing key product data and converting one or two forms into Business Central records&mdash;can often be completed in a matter of weeks, depending on data quality, approvals, and scope.
  </p>

  <h3>4. What skills does our internal team need?</h3>
  <p>
    You&rsquo;ll need someone who understands your Business Central setup, someone who owns the website, and a business lead who can decide how processes should work. A partner like Elephas can handle the integration architecture, development, and coordination between teams.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Is it safe to expose Business Central data on the website?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes&mdash;if you design it correctly. Using secure APIs, least-privilege permissions, encryption, and a proper integration layer helps you control exactly what is exposed and to whom, while keeping your core ERP protected.
