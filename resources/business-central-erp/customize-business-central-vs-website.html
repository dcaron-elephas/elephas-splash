    <h1>Should You Customize Business Central or Customize Your Website, A Practical Decision Guide</h1>

    <p>Not every requirement belongs in Business Central, and not every feature belongs on your website. This guide gives you a simple way to decide where logic should live, so you avoid performance issues, upgrade pain, and integration chaos.</p>

    <h2>Two Places to Put Logic, Business Central and the Web Layer</h2>
    <p>When new requirements show up, most teams default to one of two instincts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Put it in Business Central so it is centralized and controlled.</li>
      <li>Put it on the website so you can ship faster and avoid touching ERP.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both instincts are valid in some situations and dangerous in others. The right answer depends on what the logic does and who depends on it.</p>

    <h2>Questions to Ask Before You Decide</h2>
    <p>Use these questions as a quick triage before you open Visual Studio Code or the WordPress editor.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Is this logic core to financial accuracy or compliance?</strong> If yes, it usually belongs in Business Central.</li>
      <li><strong>Does it change how customers or prospects interact with you online?</strong> If yes, it often belongs in the website or portal first.</li>
      <li><strong>How often is this likely to change?</strong> Fast changing rules are often easier to maintain in the web layer.</li>
      <li><strong>Does this need to work even if one system is temporarily unavailable?</strong> That may imply a decoupled or staged approach.</li>
      <li><strong>Who owns and understands this logic day to day?</strong> If it is owned by finance or operations, keeping it in Business Central may make support easier.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When Customizing Business Central Makes Sense</h2>
    <p>Customizations or extensions in Business Central are usually the right choice when the requirement touches core business rules.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pricing and discount rules that affect invoices and revenue recognition.</li>
      <li>Approval workflows for purchases, credit limits, or contract terms.</li>
      <li>Posting routines and dimension logic that feed your financial reporting.</li>
      <li>Validation rules that must apply no matter where the transaction starts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In these cases, pushing the logic into Business Central keeps your system of record consistent. However, it also means you need to be careful about performance, licensing impact, and future upgrades.</p>

    <h2>When Customizing the Website or Portal Is Better</h2>
    <p>The web layer is usually the right home for logic that is about user experience, data capture, or presentation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic forms that adjust questions based on user choices.</li>
      <li>Guided steps for quote requests, onboarding, or service tickets.</li>
      <li>Customer portals that show Business Central data but present it in business friendly language.</li>
      <li>Marketing landing pages that need fast iteration and A/B testing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here, you can keep Business Central lean by treating it as the system of record, while using WordPress or another web front end to experiment and refine the experience.</p>

    <h2>Patterns for Sharing Logic Safely</h2>
    <p>Some requirements span both worlds. In those cases, patterns matter more than location.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shared configuration:</strong> Store rate tables, tax rules, or other configuration in one place, and have both Business Central and the website read from it.</li>
      <li><strong>Validation in stages:</strong> Do basic validation on the website, then enforce final rules in Business Central before posting.</li>
      <li><strong>APIs and staging tables:</strong> Use APIs to send data into Business Central staging, where more complex logic runs, instead of duplicating everything.</li>
      <li><strong>Feature flags:</strong> Introduce new behaviors behind flags so you can roll them out gradually across systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Avoid Over Customization</h2>
    <p>The risk on the Business Central side is over customization. The risk on the website side is rebuilding half of your ERP in PHP or JavaScript.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prefer configuration and extensions over code that changes core objects.</li>
      <li>Be suspicious of requests that essentially replicate standard functionality with cosmetic differences.</li>
      <li>Document custom rules and where they live so future changes do not create conflicts.</li>
      <li>Review customizations at least once a year to decide which to keep, simplify, or retire.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Simple Decision Matrix</h2>
    <p>If you want a quick rule of thumb, start here.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Financial truth and compliance:</strong> Business Central first.</li>
      <li><strong>Customer experience and lead capture:</strong> Website or portal first.</li>
      <li><strong>Operational workflows that span both:</strong> Shared patterns with staging tables and APIs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When in doubt, design the data flow and approval path on a whiteboard, then decide where each decision point belongs.</p>

    <h2>How Elephas Approaches This Decision</h2>
    <p>Because Elephas works on both Business Central and web platforms like WordPress, we are not motivated to push everything into one side. Instead, we help you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clarify what really needs to live in Business Central and what is better handled in the web layer.</li>
      <li>Design web experiences that respect the rules enforced by your ERP, instead of fighting them.</li>
      <li>Use integration patterns that keep systems decoupled but consistent, such as staging tables and event driven updates.</li>
      <li>Plan for upgrades and future changes from day one, so today’s decisions do not become tomorrow’s blockers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The result is a cleaner split between systems, fewer surprises at upgrade time, and a stack that can evolve without constant rewrites.</p>
