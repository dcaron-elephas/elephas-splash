    <h1>Common Business Central Integration Pitfalls for Growing Teams And How to Avoid Them</h1>

    <p>Most Business Central integration pain is predictable. Direct table writes, missing staging areas, no sandbox, and ad hoc scripts eventually collide. This article highlights common pitfalls and safer patterns you can use instead.</p>

    <h2>Pitfall 1, Writing Directly to Live Tables</h2>
    <p>It is tempting to connect an external system straight to Business Central tables or to rely on copy paste from spreadsheets into production.</p>
    <p>Risks include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bypassing validation and business rules.</li>
      <li>Introducing inconsistent or partial records.</li>
      <li>Creating issues that are invisible until month end or audit time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Better pattern:</strong> Use APIs and staging tables. Let Business Central apply its own rules before data is promoted into live tables.</p>

    <h2>Pitfall 2, No Staging or Intake Design</h2>
    <p>Many integrations treat Business Central as a data sink. Data is pushed in without a clear intake process.</p>
    <p>Symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Confusing error messages or silent failures.</li>
      <li>Support teams doing detective work to find out why a record did not appear.</li>
      <li>No clean place to review or correct suspicious records.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Better pattern:</strong> Design explicit intake entities, such as quote intake or lead intake. Review and promote them with clear status fields and logs.</p>

    <h2>Pitfall 3, Treating Every Integration as Real Time</h2>
    <p>Real time sounds good, but it is not always worth the complexity.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every minor outage or delay becomes a visible error.</li>
      <li>Performance problems in one system ripple across others.</li>
      <li>Debugging becomes harder because there is no buffering.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Better pattern:</strong> Reserve real time for cases where timing genuinely matters. Use scheduled or event driven batch updates for everything else.</p>

    <h2>Pitfall 4, One Off Scripts and Zaps With No Ownership</h2>
    <p>When teams move fast, they often create quick scripts, Zaps, or connectors to fill gaps. Over time, those small solutions become critical infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Risks include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No one knows what runs where or on what schedule.</li>
      <li>Behavior changes when a vendor updates an API or rate limits traffic.</li>
      <li>Security and access control are improvised instead of designed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Better pattern:</strong> Treat integrations as products. Document them, assign an owner, and move critical flows into well understood patterns over time.</p>

    <h2>Pitfall 5, Ignoring Sandboxes and Change Management</h2>
    <p>Connecting production systems directly and developing in place is fast at first and painful later.</p>
    <p>Symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Changes that work in one environment break another.</li>
      <li>Integrations that behave differently across tenants.</li>
      <li>No safe way to test new flows with realistic data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Better pattern:</strong> Use sandboxes for Business Central, your website, and other systems. Test integrations end to end before promoting changes.</p>

    <h2>Pitfall 6, No Logging or Observability</h2>
    <p>Many teams discover that an integration has been failing for weeks only when someone notices missing records.</p>
    <p>Causes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No central log of integration activity.</li>
      <li>Errors only visible in obscure system logs or email inboxes.</li>
      <li>No simple way for non developers to see integration health.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Better pattern:</strong> Log integration events with clear IDs, timestamps, and status fields. Provide basic dashboards or reports that show volume, success rates, and failures.</p>

    <h2>Pitfall 7, Over Customizing for Integration Edge Cases</h2>
    <p>Sometimes integrations are blamed for process issues. Teams add custom fields and flows to handle rare scenarios instead of addressing root causes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dozens of custom flags that no one remembers how to use.</li>
      <li>Conditional logic that makes code hard to test or change.</li>
      <li>Business rules that contradict each other across systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Better pattern:</strong> Capture edge cases in a backlog. Only bake them into systems if they recur often enough to justify automation. Otherwise, handle them as exceptions with clear manual steps.</p>

    <h2>How to Start Cleaning Up Existing Integrations</h2>
    <p>If you already feel some of these pains, you do not need to start over from scratch.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Inventory integrations and classify them by risk and importance.</li>
      <li>Introduce staging tables where they are missing for critical flows.</li>
      <li>Add logging and monitoring around the highest risk integrations.</li>
      <li>Shift some real time connections to scheduled or event based updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Iterate toward safer patterns while keeping the business running. You can tighten the architecture over time instead of betting everything on a big bang rework.</p>

    <h2>How Elephas Can Help</h2>
    <p>Because Elephas works on both Business Central and web platforms, we see the full picture of how data moves through your stack.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We review existing integrations and highlight concrete risks with real examples.</li>
      <li>We propose patterns that reduce fragility without requiring huge rewrites.</li>
      <li>We implement improved flows, logging, and monitoring step by step.</li>
      <li>We document the result so your internal team can support it long term.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal is not a perfect textbook integration architecture. It is a set of integrations that do their job reliably, are understandable, and can evolve with your business.</p>
