    <h1>From Spaghetti to System: Designing a Calm Integration Architecture Around Your ERP</h1>

    <p>Most businesses don&rsquo;t have an &ldquo;integration strategy&rdquo;, they have a pile of one-off connections that mostly work until they suddenly don&rsquo;t. A calm integration architecture starts with a clear system of record (usually your ERP), a small set of repeatable integration patterns, and boundaries that keep each app in its lane. The result: fewer surprises, cleaner data, and a stack you can actually evolve instead of fear touching.</p>

    <h2>The Real Problem Isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;No Integration&rdquo;, It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Accidental Integration&rdquo;</h2>
    <p>
      If you&rsquo;ve been in business more than a few years, your tech stack probably looks something like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An ERP or accounting system (Business Central, NAV, QuickBooks, etc.)</li>
      <li>A website on WordPress (with forms, quotes, maybe a portal)</li>
      <li>A CRM or sales tool</li>
      <li>A handful of point solutions (email marketing, help desk, scheduling, payments, etc.)</li>
      <li>A bunch of spreadsheets filling in the gaps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Individually, none of these tools are bad decisions. The pain comes from how they&rsquo;ve been connected over time:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A custom API integration someone&rsquo;s cousin wrote five years ago</li>
      <li>A Zap that only one person remembers creating</li>
      <li>A nightly export/import that &ldquo;just runs on that old server&rdquo;</li>
      <li>Three different systems all claiming to be the &ldquo;source of truth&rdquo; for customer data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This isn&rsquo;t architecture. It&rsquo;s archaeology.
    </p>
    <p>
      A proper integration architecture is about stepping back and designing how data should move through your business, on purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>What Integration Architecture Actually Is (and Isn&rsquo;t)</h2>
    <p>Integration architecture is not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;We have an API, we&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Zapier will handle it.&rdquo;</li>
      <li>&ldquo;IT can just connect those two systems real quick.&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Instead, it answers questions like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What system is the source of truth</strong> for each type of data? (customers, inventory, contracts, pricing, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>How does data move between systems?</strong> (real-time vs. batch, push vs. pull)</li>
      <li><strong>What patterns do we standardize on?</strong> (webhooks, staging tables, message queues, ETL jobs, and so on)</li>
      <li><strong>How do we evolve this in 3&ndash;5 years</strong> without ripping everything apart?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For many companies, the most pragmatic answer is:
    </p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll design our integrations around a central system of record, most often the ERP.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>
      That doesn&rsquo;t mean the ERP does everything. It means everything that matters eventually flows through it in a structured, predictable way.
    </p>

    <h2>Anchor Everything Around Your System of Record</h2>
    <p>
      Let&rsquo;s assume your ERP (for example, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central) is your core.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple, calm integration architecture might look like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>ERP as the &ldquo;brain&rdquo;</strong><br>
        Owns contracts, orders, inventory, billing, and financials, and exposes clean APIs or OData endpoints for other systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Website (WordPress) as the &ldquo;front door&rdquo;</strong><br>
        Captures quotes, requests, applications, inspections, and more. Validates data and pushes clean records into the ERP via a controlled integration plugin, and pulls back selected ERP data for portals or dashboards.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>CRM as the &ldquo;sales memory&rdquo;</strong><br>
        Owns leads, opportunities, and some customer engagement history. Syncs key account and deal data with the ERP (no more manual export/import).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Marketing &amp; service tools as specialists</strong><br>
        Email platforms subscribe to events (new customer, contract renewal, overdue balance). Help desk tools sync key ticket and asset info with the ERP so operations sees the full story.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The key idea:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Each system has a clear job and a clear contract for how it talks to the others.</strong></p>
    <p>
      No system is trying to be everything. No random one-off feeds. No mystery overlaps.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Integration Patterns That Keep Things Sane</h2>
    <p>
      You don&rsquo;t need 20 different integration patterns. You need a small handful that you repeat consistently.
    </p>

    <h3>1. API + Staging Tables (ERP-Centric Pattern)</h3>
    <p>
      In this pattern:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>WordPress or other web apps submit data to the ERP via an API.</li>
      <li>Data lands in <strong>staging tables</strong> first, not directly into your live transactional tables.</li>
      <li>Validation and business rules run inside the ERP where you already have governance.</li>
      <li>Approved records get promoted to live (for example, a &ldquo;Quote Intake&rdquo; record becomes a real quote).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Why it&rsquo;s good:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduces risk from bad or partial data.</li>
      <li>Keeps business rules in one place (the ERP), not scattered across multiple apps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Event-Driven Push (Webhooks)</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of every system polling every other system (&ldquo;Anything new yet?&rdquo;), use events:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;New quote created&rdquo;</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Contract activated&rdquo;</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Inventory level changed&rdquo;</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Customer updated&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each event can trigger downstream actions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Update your CRM.</li>
      <li>Send onboarding sequences.</li>
      <li>Recalculate capacity planning.</li>
      <li>Notify operations in an internal portal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This scales better than a mess of scheduled jobs that all run at 2 a.m. and sometimes step on each other.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Batch Sync for Non-Critical Data</h3>
    <p>
      Not everything needs to be real-time. For reference data (such as product lists and non-urgent statuses), a nightly or hourly sync is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cheaper</li>
      <li>Simpler</li>
      <li>More predictable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The trick is to decide upfront what needs real-time vs. batch, instead of having it decided by whoever shouted loudest first.
    </p>

    <h2>How This Shows Up in a Real Stack (WordPress + ERP + CRM)</h2>
    <p>
      Here&rsquo;s a simple example scenario:
    </p>

    <h3>Use Case: Online Quote Request &rarr; ERP &rarr; CRM &rarr; Operations</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Customer submits a quote form on WordPress.</strong><br>
        Front-end validation ensures required fields are present and formatted. A custom integration plugin structures the payload and sends it to the ERP intake endpoint.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ERP receives the data into a &ldquo;Quote Intake&rdquo; staging area.</strong><br>
        Business rules check customer accounts, pricing, availability, and credit flags. If valid, the system creates an official quote and assigns a quote number.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ERP publishes an event: &ldquo;Quote Created.&rdquo;</strong><br>
        The CRM receives the event and either creates a new lead/opportunity or updates an existing one. An internal operations portal shows the new quote in the queue.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Marketing subscribes selectively.</strong><br>
        If permitted, an email is triggered with next steps or a follow-up sequence.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      From the outside, it looks like &ldquo;our website integrates with our ERP and CRM.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the hood, it&rsquo;s actually:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>One well-structured <strong>intake</strong> pattern.</li>
      <li>One <strong>staging and validation</strong> pattern.</li>
      <li>One <strong>event publishing</strong> pattern.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      &hellip;reused over and over for different forms and workflows.
    </p>

    <h2>Signs You&rsquo;re Living in &ldquo;Integration Spaghetti&rdquo;</h2>
    <p>
      If any of these sound familiar, you don&rsquo;t just need another integration, you need integration architecture:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You maintain multiple spreadsheets purely to reconcile systems that &ldquo;should already match.&rdquo;</li>
      <li>Nobody is certain which system holds the &ldquo;real&rdquo; customer record.</li>
      <li>You&rsquo;re afraid to upgrade or replace tools because &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not sure what else that touches.&rdquo;</li>
      <li>Integrations were built by different vendors with different assumptions and zero documentation.</li>
      <li>Fixing one data issue often breaks something somewhere else.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is normal. But it&rsquo;s not inevitable.
    </p>

    <h2>A Practical Way to Start Cleaning It Up</h2>
    <p>
      You don&rsquo;t have to redesign everything at once. Here&rsquo;s a phased approach that fits real-world constraints.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Inventory the Systems and Flows (No Tools Yet)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>List every major system: ERP, website, CRM, marketing, service, file storage, and so on.</li>
      <li>For each, write:
        <ul>
          <li>What data it creates or owns.</li>
          <li>What data it consumes.</li>
          <li>How integrations currently work (API, file, Zap, manual, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Even a messy spreadsheet is a huge step forward.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Declare Your System of Record Per Data Type</h3>
    <p>
      For each data domain (customers, contracts, inventory, invoices, quotes, assets):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose <strong>one</strong> source of truth.</li>
      <li>Note where that data is copied for convenience (and how it&rsquo;s kept in sync).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This alone cuts down on whole categories of arguments and confusion.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Standardize 3&ndash;5 Integration Patterns</h3>
    <p>
      Decide which patterns you&rsquo;re going to use going forward:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>API + staging tables into the ERP.</li>
      <li>Webhooks / event notifications out of the ERP.</li>
      <li>Scheduled batch sync for reference data.</li>
      <li>Possibly a thin middleware layer where necessary (but not for everything).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Then stop approving one-off &ldquo;snowflake&rdquo; integrations that don&rsquo;t fit those patterns.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4: Tackle the Highest-Friction Flow First</h3>
    <p>
      Pick one high-impact, high-friction scenario:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quote intake.</li>
      <li>New customer onboarding.</li>
      <li>Inventory availability.</li>
      <li>Service ticket visibility for operations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Redesign that flow using your new patterns. Prove the value, then repeat for the next one.
    </p>

    <h2>Where Elephas Fits In</h2>
    <p>
      This is the kind of work that lives in the uncomfortable middle between &ldquo;IT project&rdquo; and &ldquo;operations cleanup.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s rarely anyone&rsquo;s full-time job, but it touches everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elephas can help with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integration architecture design around your ERP and website.</li>
      <li>Patterns and governance so future integrations don&rsquo;t degrade into spaghetti again.</li>
      <li>Hands-on builds: custom WordPress plugins, Business Central integrations, and portals.</li>
      <li>Documentation and knowledge transfer so your team can maintain and extend things safely.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The goal isn&rsquo;t to make your stack &ldquo;fancy.&rdquo; The goal is to make it <strong>calm, predictable, and upgradeable</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <h3>Do I really need an ERP as the center of my architecture?</h3>
    <p>
      Not always. But having a clear &ldquo;home base&rdquo; for operational and financial truth (often an ERP) makes integration decisions much cleaner. When no system is clearly in charge, every integration turns into a negotiation.
    </p>

    <h3>Can&rsquo;t we just use a no-code integration platform and skip all this?</h3>
    <p>
      Tools like Zapier, Make, or full iPaaS platforms are great, as long as they&rsquo;re used inside a deliberate architecture. Without that, they just become a faster way to build more spaghetti.
    </p>

    <h3>What if our systems don&rsquo;t have great APIs?</h3>
    <p>
      You can still design good architecture. You might need staging tables, file-based imports, or an intermediate database. The important part is that the patterns are intentional, documented, and consistently applied.
    </p>

    <h3>How long does an &ldquo;integration cleanup&rdquo; usually take?</h3>
    <p>
      It depends on how tangled things are, but even a 2&ndash;4 week architecture and discovery phase can give you a clear roadmap, reduce risk, and prevent expensive rework later.
    </p>

    <h2>Want a Calm Integration Story Instead of a Heroic One?</h2>
    <p>
      If you&rsquo;re tired of living in &ldquo;who built this and why?&rdquo; territory every time you touch your systems, it might be time to step back and design your integration architecture properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elephas can help you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Map your current integrations.</li>
      <li>Define a sane, ERP-centered architecture.</li>
      <li>Implement the highest-impact flows first.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You shouldn&rsquo;t need a hero every time you want two systems to talk. You should have a system for that.
