<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Month Day, Year]</p>

<p>
  Welcome to <strong>Elephas</strong> (“Elephas,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) 
  govern your access to and use of our website, <strong>elephas.us</strong> (the “Site”), and any 
  content, features, or services made available through it (collectively, the “Services”).
</p>
<p>
  By accessing or using the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. 
  If you do not agree, please do not use the Site.
</p>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Business Central consulting,</li>
  <li>ERP and integration services,</li>
  <li>Web development, hosting, and related offerings.</li>

  tailored to your situation.
</p>

<h2>3. Quotes, Proposals, and Service Agreements</h2>
<p>
  Any information about pricing, packages, or services on this Site is <strong>illustrative only</strong> 
  and does not constitute a binding offer.
</p>
<p>
  All actual services provided by Elephas – including consulting, development, hosting, or managed services – 
  are governed by <strong>separate written agreements</strong> (such as proposals, MSAs, SOWs, or order forms) 
  between Elephas and the client. If there is any conflict between those agreements and these Terms, 
  the separate written agreement controls for that client relationship.
</p>

<h2>4. Accounts &amp; Secure Areas (If Applicable)</h2>
<p>
  If we provide client portals or secure areas where you can log in:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.</li>
  <li>You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access or use of your account.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to any account if we believe these Terms have been 
  violated or the account is being misused.
</p>

<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>
  Unless otherwise indicated, all content on the Site is owned or controlled by Elephas or its licensors, including but not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Text, copy, and graphics,</li>
  <li>Logos and branding,</li>
  <li>Icons, images, and illustrations,</li>
  <li>Layouts, user interfaces, and design elements,</li>
  <li>Custom code, components, and other materials.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and view the Site 
  for your own internal business or personal use.
</p>
<p>You <strong>may not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy, reproduce, modify, distribute, display, or create derivative works from the Site’s content, 
      except as allowed by applicable law or with our prior written consent,</li>
  <li>Remove any copyright, trademark, or proprietary rights notices,</li>
  <li>Use our name, logo, or branding in a way that suggests endorsement or partnership without written permission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any rights not expressly granted in these Terms are reserved by Elephas.</p>

<h2>6. User Submissions &amp; Feedback</h2>
<p>
  If you send us any ideas, feedback, suggestions, or other content (“Feedback”):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You understand and agree that we may use that Feedback for any purpose (including improving our services, 
    marketing, or developing new offerings) without obligation to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    You confirm that you have the right to share the Feedback and that it does not violate any third-party rights.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We are not obligated to maintain Feedback as confidential unless a separate written agreement says otherwise.
</p>

<h2>7. Third-Party Tools, Links &amp; Integrations</h2>
<p>
  The Site may reference or link to third-party tools, services, or websites (for example: Microsoft Business Central, 
  hosting providers, analytics tools, or integration partners).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>These third parties are not controlled by Elephas.</li>
  <li>We are not responsible for the content, policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</li>
  <li>
    Your use of third-party sites or tools is at your own risk and may be governed by the third party’s own terms 
    and privacy policies.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>8. No Warranties</h2>
<p>
  The Site and its content are provided on an <strong>“as is” and “as available”</strong> basis.
</p>
<p>
  To the fullest extent permitted by law, Elephas disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, 
  including but not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Warranties of merchantability,</li>
  <li>Fitness for a particular purpose,</li>
  <li>Non-infringement,</li>
  <li>Accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the content.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not warrant that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Site will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free,</li>
  <li>Any defects will be corrected,</li>
  <li>The Site or the server that makes it available are free of viruses or other harmful components.</li>
</ul>
<p>You use the Site at your own risk.</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
  To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall Elephas, its owners, partners, employees, contractors, 
  or affiliates be liable for any:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,</li>
  <li>Loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities,</li>
</ul>
<p>
  arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Site, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
</p>
<p>
  To the extent any liability is found despite the above, our total aggregate liability relating to your use of the Site 
  shall not exceed <strong>one hundred U.S. dollars (USD $100)</strong> or the minimum amount permitted by law, 
  whichever is lower.
</p>
<p>
  Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.
</p>

<h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
<p>
  You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Elephas and its owners, partners, employees, contractors, and affiliates 
  from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out 
  of or related to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your use of the Site,</li>
  <li>Your violation of these Terms,</li>
  <li>Your violation of any applicable law or rights of any third party.</li>
</ul>

  We may update, modify, or discontinue any part of the Site at any time, with or without notice.
</p>
<p>
  We may also update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page.
